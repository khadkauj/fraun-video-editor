This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

### Idea
In our design, we effectively overlay a canvas element onto a video element, both of which are absolutely positioned within a shared relative container. This allows the video and canvas to perfectly align, creating the illusion that the animations rendered on the canvas are happening directly on the video. Since canvas is transparent by default, any drawings or animations on it appear as if they are part of the underlying video, providing a seamless viewing experience. The canvas then acts as an active layer where we can introduce interactive elements, animations, or even real-time information overlays without altering the original video content.
